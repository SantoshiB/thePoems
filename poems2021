    No Time Like The Present
    Poet: Phoebe Cary

    If you’re told to do a thing,
    And mean to do it really,
    Never let it be by halves;
    Do it fully, freely.

    Do not make a poor excuse,
    Waiting, weak, unsteady;
    All obedience worth the name
    Must be prompt and ready.

    If you’re told to learn a task,
    And you should begin it,
    Do not tell your teacher, "Yes,
    I’m coming in a minute."

    Waste not moments nor your words
    In telling what you could do
    Some other time; the present is
    For doing what you should do.


    Failure
    by George Eliot

    Failure after long perseverance is
    much grander than never to
    have a striving good enough
    to be called a failure.


    Success In Life
    by Webster

    If you wish success in life
    Make perseverance your bosom friend,
    Experience your wise counselor,
    Caution your elder brother
    And hope your guardian genius.


    Perseverance
    Poet Unknown

    The pine that stands upon the wooded mountain
    Gains not in stature in a single day;
    The noble river springs not from one fountain,
    But gathers up its strength along its way.

    The aloe hears for years the autumn’s dirges,
    Before it shows its blossoms to the skies;
    The coral reef, that breaks the ocean’s surges,
    Through centuries of growth alone can rise.

    Thus, through her works, Dame Nature offers ever
    For our acceptance one persistent thought:
    ’Tis but by patient, sturdy, brave endeavor,
    The greatest, best, and grandest things are wrought.


    Perseverance
    Poet Unknown

    It's the coward who quits to misfortune,
    'Tis the knave who changes each day,
    'Tis the fool who wins half the battle,
    Then throws all his chances away.
    There is little life but labor.
    And the morning may find that a dream;
    Success is the bride of endeavor,
    And luck but a meteor's gleam.
    The time to succeed is when others,
    Discouraged, show traces of tire;
    The battle is fought in the home-stretch,
    And won twixt the flag and the wire.


    Patience and Perseverance
    by Arthur Penrhyn Stanley

    So long as our existence lasts,
    we must not give up the duty of cheerfulness and hope.
    He who has guided us through the day,
    will guide us through the night also.
    The pillar of darkness often turns into a pillar of fire.
    Have patience and perseverance;
    believe that there is still a future before us,
    and we shall at last reach the haven where we would be.
